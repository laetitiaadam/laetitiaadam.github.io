# Exposing the Hidden Drivers of Tree Decline

Trees are vital for a balanced ecosystem on planet earth: They produce oxygen, absorb carbon dioxide, and provide habitats for most land-based species. But what happens when our forests are dying?

I watched the tree decline at *Harz Nationalpark* and *Forest of Thuringia* over many years. Where once was a healthy forest, there is now a scenery of destruction. However, the cause is almost hidden - it is hidden under the bark. Longer periods of drought weaken spruce trees and allow the bark beetle to spread. In a balanced ecosystem this insect is useful for decomposing dead trees. Once it´s population is out of balance the bark beetle becomes a major driver of tree loss and forest decline.

As part of my class in *Advanced Cartography* we dealt with the Sustainable Development Goals by the United Nations. Goal 15.2 addresses the protection of healthy forests. This was my motivation to further analyse the impact of bark beetle infestation on our forests.

Take look at my story map to learn more about this tiny insect and its far-reaching consequences.
