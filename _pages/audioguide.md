# A Selfguided Tour Through Town

At ten different locations visitors can listen to interesting facts and stories about the village of Wennigsen. This <a href="(https://www.wennigsen.de/portal/seiten/audioguide-wennigsen-ein-hoerspaziergang-900000504-8779.html)">audioguide</a> has been created by the municipality for which I have designed the mapping. Each location of the ten places of interest are equipped with a map and signpost.
