  <p><a href="https://weimar.wandelkarten.de/">Wandelkarte Weimar</a> is a comprehensive guide that highlights over 100 local businesses and initiatives committed to sustainability across various sectors, including "Food & Drink," "Community & Culture," "Fashion & Cosmetics," and "Repair & Services". Each business and initiative is briefly introduced and categorized based on sustainability criteria such as "organic," "regional," "fair," "vegan," or "reuse." </p>
  
  <p>Since 2022, I have been involved in a group of volunteers to make the popular print cards permanently available online. This new version allows users to easily update existing entries and suggest new ones. It is also linked to other regional sustainability maps, such as <a href="https://thueringen-nachhaltig.de/">Th√ºringen Nachhaltig</a> and the <a href="https://www.kartevonmorgen.org/">Karte von Morgen</a> allowing for cross-referencing and the sharing of entries across platforms.</p>
