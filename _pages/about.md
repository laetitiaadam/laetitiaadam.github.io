In October 2025, I will begin my **Master’s degree in Applied Geoinformatics** at **University of Salzburg**.

Currently, I am working as a **research assistant** at the **Chair for Transport System Planning** at **Bauhaus-University Weimar**. Our research project applies **machine learning methods** to predict and evaluate **urban air quality**.

Previously, I graduated with a **B.Sc. in Urban Studies** from Bauhaus-University Weimar. My thesis focused on **transport justice** and the **accessibility of cycling infrastructure**. I developed a GIS tool to calculate the share of cycling infrastructure on everyday journeys. The outcome is a **bicycle-equity index** for each place of living which can identify whether specific neighbourhoods or social groups benefit more than others from existing cycling infrastructure. 

During my bachelor’s degree, I studied for a year at **Universidad de Cantabria** in Santander, Spain, where I completed courses in GIS. This allowed me to combine my **sociological perspective as an urban planner** with skills in **geospatial technologies**. Work experiences in the field of transport system planning were valuable opportunities for applying my skills. Next to my position as research assistant at the Chair for Transport System Planning, I completed an **internship at Planungsgemeinschaft Verkehr PGV-Alrutz in Hanover, Germany**. The office is involved in cycling concepts for cities and municipalities promoting environmentally friendly, socially acceptable and safe cycling. 

My main interests lie in the **acquisition and analysis of geospatial data** using tools such as **GeoPandas/Python**, **QGIS**, and **ArcGIS**, particularly within **urban planning and mobility** contexts. I’m fluent in **English** and **Spanish**, and thrive in international environments.

Some of my projects are presented on this website. My full CV is below.
