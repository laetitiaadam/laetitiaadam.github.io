# A GIS-Tool for Analyzing Access to Cycling Infrastructure Across Social Groups

Strategies on sustainable transportation suggest improvements for bicycle-friendly cities. However, they often overlook whether all residents benefit from these changes. I adressed this issue in my **bachelor thesis** by developing a GIS tool that calculates a bicycle equity index for each place of residence in a city. The index shows the share of cycling infrastructure on everyday routes. With the aim to expand cycling infrastructure in a socio-political way, the work analyses correlations between the created bicycle equity index and social groups. In this case study the tool was applied to the city of Weimar, Germany. The findings show a correlation between a high bicycle equity index and milieus of the upper class as well as a correlation between a low bicycle equity index and milieus of the lower middle class. The tool does not only serve for research purposes but can be applied to any municipality by practitioners.

The methodology as well as my discussion are presented on the poster below. I am excited to have received **first place** with this contribution at **AGIT Conference Poster Award 2025** in Salzburg!
